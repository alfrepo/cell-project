# Project: Scalable On-Premise Deployments with a Cell-Based Architecture

## 1. Summary
This project demonstrates the strategy and design for deploying our application on-premise using a **cell-based architecture**. This modern deployment pattern partitions our infrastructure into multiple, independent, and identical instances called "**cells**." Adopting this model will significantly improve the scalability, reliability, and maintainability of our on-premise installations, moving us from a monolithic approach to a more resilient, distributed system.

## 3. Core Concepts
The architecture is built on a few fundamental principles:

*   **Cell:** A cell is a self-contained, fully-functional instance of the entire application stack. This includes compute, networking, storage, databases, and all application services. Each cell is a replica of every other cell.
*   **Isolation:** Cells are strongly isolated. A failure in one cell does not cascade to others. This is the key to improving fault tolerance.
*   **Scalability Unit:** The cell is the unit of scalability. To handle more load, we add more cells. This provides a predictable, horizontal scaling model.
*   **Global Services:** A minimal set of shared services (the "**control plane**") exists outside the cells to handle tasks like routing users to the correct cell and orchestrating deployments. This layer is designed for extreme stability and is updated infrequently.
